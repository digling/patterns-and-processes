# Processes involving the lexicon

These processes leave patterns of similarity in the data sampled by
sufficiently large, consistent wordlist that are restricted to ideally
one, but possibly more than one, form for each concept to be elicited.

| Name of the process | Level | Example patterns |

| Systematic sound change | Common descent | [Sound correspondences](#sound-correspondences) |
| Parallel semantic shift | Linguistic universals |  |
| Analogy | Within-Language |  |
| Contamination (a type of Analogy) | Within-Language |  |
| Synonyms | Within-Language |  |
| Chance similarities | Random |  |
| Morphological processes | Common descent |  |
| Compounding (a Morphological process) | Common descent |  |
| Dervivation (a Morphological process) | Common descent |  |
| Borrowing | Any pair of languages in contact |  |
| Matter copying (a type of Borrowing) | Any pair of languages in contact |  |
| Calquing (a type of Borrowing) | Any pair of lanugages in contact |  |

## Sound correspondences

### Germanic sound correspondences

| Concept | German | English | Dutch |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
|‘to do’  | tuːn   | duː     | duːn   |
 
## Taboo-induced individual sound change (?)

Chinese «bird» is now "niǎo" < "diǎo" (and "diǎo" also means "penis"). 

## Cases of "contamination" (some kind of analogy?)

Think of "left" vs. "right", and "rechts" vs. "links": the English words end in -t and the German words in -s. This may be the practice of naming opposition pairs often together, so they get more similar on the one hand, but need to be kept distinct on the other hand.
